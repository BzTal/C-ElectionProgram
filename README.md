This is my final project in " C++ Object oriented programming" course. 

-What can thie program do?-
* can run two types of elections-a simple election (has only one county) and a normal election (can handle multiple counties).
* The user can enter the election's date, counties, citizens, parties, and votes.
* The program will calculate and display detailed result. 
* The user can also use the program to save the election's data into a binary file, as well as load an election from a binary file. 

may the best party win(:
